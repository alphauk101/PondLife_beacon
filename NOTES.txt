POND LIFE - APP FLOW

ALL IN SERVICE!

something starts the app - possibly an alarm manager, possibly a another service.

WAKE UP!
		Check BT 
		
		if BT enabled carry on - else reset alarm (do nothing else save power)
		
		Do a BLE scan - as soon as our device is found disable the scan.
		
		Take the relevant information out of the adv data and display in notification (this may be a activity coming to the front and shout lots)
		
		if everything is ok then go back to sleep. (reset alarm and self terminate)
		

Manually started!

	run the service and get the results and display.
